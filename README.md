 # Final Project â€“ Motor Vehicle Collisions/Crashes

## Overview

This project involves designing advanced data architectures for business intelligence, specifically focusing on motor vehicle collisions/crashes data from three cities: New York, Chicago, and Austin. The data is sourced from respective city data portals and is used to analyze various aspects of traffic crashes, such as the number of accidents, areas with the highest number of accidents, injuries, pedestrian involvement, and more.

## Data Sources

The crash data is obtained from the Department of Transportation for each city:
- [New York](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)
- [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data)
- [Austin](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-Crash-Report-Data-Crash-Level-Records/y2wy-tgr5/about_data)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Profiling and Staging
- **Data Profiling:** Use Alteryx or ydata profile for initial data profiling.
- **Data Staging:** Create staging tables using Talend for ETL jobs, following standard practices. Use Azure SQL Server, MySQL, or SQL Server.
- **Dimensional Model:** Design facts and dimensions, create a mapping document, explain source to target mappings, and document transformations.
- **Submission Deadline:** Part 1 due by 31st March EOD.

### Phase 2: Data Integration and Querying
- **Staging to Integration:** Implement ETL jobs using Talend, validate data, and explain any row rejections.
- **Business Questions:** Query the dimensional data model to answer provided business questions.
- **Submission Deadline:** Part 2 due by 7th April EOD.

### Phase 3: Visualization
- **Tools:** Use Tableau and Power BI to create visualizations. Optionally publish reports to the cloud if access issues are resolved.
- **Submission Deadline:** Part 3 due by 14th April EOD.

## Analysis Questions

1. **Accidents Count:** How many accidents occurred in NYC, Austin, and Chicago?
2. **Top Areas:** Which areas in the 3 cities had the greatest number of accidents? (Top 3 areas in each city)
3. **Injuries Count:** How many accidents resulted in just injuries? (Overall and by city)
4. **Pedestrian Involvement:** How often are pedestrians involved in accidents? (Overall and by city)
5. **Seasonality:** When do most accidents happen? (Seasonality report)
6. **Motorist Injuries/Kills:** How many motorists are injured or killed in accidents? (Overall and by city)
7. **Fatal Accidents Areas:** Which top 5 areas in 3 cities have the most fatal number of accidents?
8. **Time-Based Analysis:** Time-based analysis of accidents (Time of the day, day of the week, weekdays or weekends)
9. **Fatality Analysis:** Are pedestrians killed more often than road users?
10. **Common Factors:** What are the most common factors involved in accidents?

## Inconsistencies and Resolutions

### Chicago
1. **Contributing Factors:** Resolved missing contributing factors using specific codes.
2. **Contributing Factor Columns:** Merged and normalized data from 'Primary Contributing Cause' and 'Secondary Contributing Cause'.
3. **Speed Limit Data:** Updated inconsistent speed limit values from 0 to -1.
4. **Date and Time Formatting:** Split combined date and time into separate columns, changed date format to yyyy-mm-dd.

### New York
1. **Contributing Factor and Vehicle Type Columns:** Merged and normalized multiple columns for contributing factors and vehicle types.
2. **Crash Date Column:** Left an entry with an extra string "ParkingLOT)" as is.
3. **Inconsistent Vehicle Type Columns:** Left non-standard values unchanged.
4. **Units Involved Calculation:** Computed 'Units Involved' using other columns.
5. **Crash Time Column:** Added seconds to the time format.
6. **Date Column with Time Component:** Removed time component from the date column.

### Austin
1. **Vehicle Type Data:** Computed and inferred vehicle types.
2. **Contributing Factor Columns:** Merged and normalized multiple contributing factor columns.
3. **Date and Time Formatting:** Split combined date and time data into separate columns, changed date format to yyyy-mm-dd.

## Dimensional Model

The dimensional model is a star schema designed for traffic accident data analysis. The schema includes:

- **Fact Table:** Contains measures such as total injury count, pedestrian injury count, various types of injuries and deaths, and the number of units involved in accidents.
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - **Time Dimension (Time_DM):** Attributes include time, creation date, and workflow.
  - **Geographical Dimension (Geo_DM):** Attributes include latitude, longitude, street name, and city.
  - **Date Dimension (Date_DM):** Date-specific information for trend analysis.
  - **Speed Limit Dimension (SpeedLimit_DM):** Speed limit information.
  - **Crash Dimension (Crash_DM):** Specific details about the crashes.
  - **Contributing Factor Dimension (ContributingFactor_DM):** Data on various contributing factors.
  - **Vehicle Dimension (Vehicle_DM):** Information about vehicles involved in accidents.
  - **Fact Tables for Contributing Factors and Vehicle Junctions:** Used to scrutinize specific aspects of accidents.
